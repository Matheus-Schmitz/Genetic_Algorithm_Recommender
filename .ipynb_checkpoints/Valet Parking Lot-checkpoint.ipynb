    "Design and implement a valet parking lot.\n",

    "Assumptions:\n",
    "- The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars and vans\n",
    "- The parking lot has 10 identical rows, each with 2 motorcycle spots and 5 regular spots\n",
    "- A motorcycle can park in either spot\n",
    "- A car can park in a regular spot\n",
    "- A van can park, but it will take up 3 regular spots\n",
    "- A vehicle must pay $1 per hour for each spot it takes up\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few methods that you should implement:\n",
    "- Handle when a vehicle arrives. The method should take in the vehicle's type and license plate.\n",
    "- Handle when a vehicle wants to leave. The method should take in the vehicle's license plate, and return the $ amount they should be charged.\n",
